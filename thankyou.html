<p>
...our learnings with you. Mixtable was a Munich based startup built up and run from April 2013 until August 2014. Our mission was to bring people together offline! On this webpage you will find information about our story and who shaped the Mixtable journey. In addition we collected some of our learnings regarding business and technical insights. Don’t be shy and send us an email if you have questions or other suggestions.
